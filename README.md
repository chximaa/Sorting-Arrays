# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms – Multi-Language Implementation (C / C++ / Java / Python)

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a **menu-based implementation of 10 classic sorting algorithms** <br>
written in **four programming languages**:

* **C**
* **C++**
* **Java**
* **Python**

The goal is to **learn, compare, and understand sorting algorithms** both **theoretically**<br>
and **practically**, while also observing how the same logic is implemented across different languages.

Each implementation includes:

* A **menu-driven interface**
* **Clear English explanations** of each algorithm
* **Time complexity analysis**
* **Advantages and disadvantages**
* Interactive user input and output

java sort
```

### 🔹 Python

```bash
python sort.py
```

## 📋 Features

* 📌 Same algorithms implemented across **4 languages**
* 📘 Educational explanations before execution
* 🔁 Original array preserved (sorting uses a copy)
* 🧪 Works with user-defined input size
* 💻 No external libraries required

---

## 📊 Example Output

```
Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Advantages: Stable, predictable performance
Disadvantages: Requires extra memory

Sorted Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## 📚 Learning Objectives

* Understand **algorithmic complexity**
* Compare **language-specific implementations**
* Distinguish **comparison vs non-comparison** sorting algorithms
* Improve problem-solving and coding skills in multiple languages
* Prepare for **exams and technical interviews**
